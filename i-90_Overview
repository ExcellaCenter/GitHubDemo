Welcome to the Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card
"The Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (I-90) is used to replace or renew a Permanent Resident Card (formerly known as the Alien Registration Card or referred to as the Green Card). 

Submit this application if your Green Card:
• Has expired
• Will expire 
• Was lost, stolen, or destroyed

A Green Card is proof of your permanent resident status in the United States. It also serves as a valid identification document and proof that you are authorized to live and work permanently in the United States.

Before you start your application
Eligibility
"You may be eligible to apply to replace your Green Card if you are a:

• Lawful permanent resident
• Permanent resident in commuter status 
• Conditional permanent resident whose current Green Card will not expire in the next 90 days

If you are a conditional permanent resident and your Green Card has expired or will expire in the next 90 days, you will need to file a Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (I-751) to remove the conditions on your card."					
		<h3>	Fee	<p>	"We will automatically calculate the cost for you when you submit your application. 

The application fee is $540. This includes the $455 standard fee plus an $85 biometrics service fee. You do not have to pay the application fee if: 

• Your previous card was issued but never delivered 
• Your card was incorrect because of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) error

If you are 14 years old and your card will expire after your 16th birthday, you only have to pay the $85 biometrics fee.
